# Metabase API â€“ Permissions Use Cases
Metabase's permissions model is powerful and can get complex fast, especially when a user belongs to multiple groups with different settings. For a deeper dive into how Metabase handles permissions across groups, collections, and databases, check out the official documentation:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Understanding Permissions in Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/permissions/start)

This example demonstrates how to use the Metabase API to identify and resolve **conflicting data access permissions** between groups, databases, and collections.
